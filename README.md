Challenges Faced

    Managing pagination and filters in sync without data loss

    Designing a fluid UI across screen sizes with pure CSS

    Avoiding code duplication while keeping JavaScript modular

    Handling delete/edit edge cases (e.g., last employee on page)

What I’d Improve with More Time
    Add dynamic pagination size (10/25/50/100)

    Store data in localStorage for session persistence

    Add confirmation modals with animations

    Refactor code into ES6 modules for maintainability

    Improve accessibility with ARIA labels and keyboard nav
